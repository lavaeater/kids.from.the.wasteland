Mae: Testing out a new options system.
-> This is option 1
    Mae: Then my response dialogue would go here. 
    Mae: Pretty cool huh?
    -> You can even nest options
        Molly: Oh, rad.
    -> This middle option should not appear. <<if $option_available is 1>>
        Molly: It sure didn't.
    -> You skipped an option because it didn't appear! Hopefully. This one should appear though. <<if $option_available is 0>>
    -> I Think you can anyways?
        Molly: Sweet well... you tried!
-> This is option 2
    Mae: Then my response for option two would go here.
-> Oh, that's kinda neat! Super neat? Maybe it is...
    Mae: Yeah it saves time having to make extra nodes etc.
    Mae: Also it should still work with if statements...
    <<if $didnt_work is 0>>
        Mae: omg it does!
    <<endif>>
Mae: Then we can rejoin back here. No need to create and link a bunch of nodes!
