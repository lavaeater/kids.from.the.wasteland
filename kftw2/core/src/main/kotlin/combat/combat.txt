Just some random thoughts on combat.

I like combat. But combat is slow in turn-based games. If the combat is well done,
it's slow and boring and I don't like slow and boring...

So, weapons and attacks... must be possible to define with just
a few lines of code - or a human readable definition.

Where do attacks come from? The inventory or what?

I want to go for several things:

1. Fast battles - not too long, because then combat becomes a drudge.

Examples:

The player is "attacked" by or "stumbles upon" a agent in the wild. The agent either
sees the player as food or wants to discourage the player by attacking. Well, wild animals never
fight to the death. So, after 1-3 rounds, the battle should be over. Either the player withdraws to
heal their wounds, or the agent is hurt or scared enough to motivate it to just leave.

The player is attacked by a roving band of one or more bandits.

Bandits want something from the players - or to take the players as slaves. So, being dead or a slave
is really bad. So running away is always an option.

Bandits should be easily demotivated by injuries etc.

Should combat have effect later, like infections etc?

So, getting hurt should be really bad.
